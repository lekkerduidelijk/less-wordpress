# LESS Wordpress theme

This theme is entirely based on Walker Hamiltons [HTML5 Boilerplate for Wordpress](https://github.com/walker/html5-boilerplate-for-wordpress).

Walker did a splendid job and I have used his theme for quite some years now.
I found myself stripping out the same stuff over and over again, that's why I created my own version of it.
